<p>
"Kick Now", is designed to help users track their favorite streamers on the platform Kick.com (Not affiliated). It allows users to add or remove streamers from their list, and it automatically updates the status of each streamer, indicating whether they are currently live or offline. The add-on also provides notifications (Windows notification) when a streamer goes live. Additionally, a filter, a simple press button that will add the streamer to the list of notification as well as a refresh interval, since I don't have access to the Kick API, I can't make it convenient to use, you have to add each streamer manually.
